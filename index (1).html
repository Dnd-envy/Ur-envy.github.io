   <h2>I KNOW</h2>
   
   <h6>
   I know everything feels super heavy, but always remember that storms don't last forever. You're strong and capable or overcoming whatever life throws at you. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but it's also important to take a deep breath, gather your strength, and take things one step at a  time. You've got this! I know you can o it bebe! I'm always here for you hmm?</h6>
   
   <h2>RUN TO ME</h2>
     
   
   <h6>Run to me when you feel like you have no one, surrounds you and you just need to feel understood. I want to be that safe place for you, the one you turn to when everything else feels uncertain. You don’t have to carry anything alone not your pain, not your worries, not your fears. Tell me about your day, even the smallest details the good, the bad, the boring, or the overwhelming. I want to hear it all, because your chats matters to me. What’s on your mind matters to me. If something bothering you, don’t hold it in. Share it with me. Let me help lighten the weight on your heart.

<p>And when the nights feel too long or your emotions feel like too much, you can call me. Cry if you need to I’ll be here, patient and present. I won’t try to fix everything. I’ll just be here, holding space for you, offering you comfort and understanding without judgement. You are never alone not while I’m here. No matter what you’re going through, I will always be someone you can lean on. Your pain will never scare me away, and your silence will never go unnoticed. I want to be your calm in the chaos, your warmth when you feel cold, your constant when everything else feels like it’s falling apart.</p>

<p>So please bebe, run to me, always.</p></h6>
